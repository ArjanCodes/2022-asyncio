# Asyncio

In this video I talk about concurrent programming in Python and show you some examples of what you can do with the asyncio package. I also show a few more advanced use-cases such as retrieving data from an http endpoint asynchronously, using async with generators and comprehensions, and finally how to turn non-asynchronous code into asycn code that nicely fits into the async event loop.

Video: coming up.
